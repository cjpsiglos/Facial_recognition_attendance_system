Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a comprehensive attendance system that leverages the power of face recognition to identify individuals and mark their attendance. Built with Python, Flask, OpenCV, and Firebase, the system provides an efficient and automated solution to track attendance in various settings such as universities or workplaces.
The system allows users to upload their image to the database, which is then used to recognize their face during attendance checks. The recognized faces are matched with the database, and the attendance is updated in real-time. The system also includes a secure login feature for teachers to view the attendance records.
